-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Welcome to the Blender 3D Presentation Plug-in.
- It is advised that you donwload the TEMPLATE FILE for creating Components, Presentations and Presenting.
- You can download the template file - together with full documentation - at: 
    
https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/sojkamat/blender-presentation-plug-in
    or at:
https://github.com/MatyasSojka/Blender-Presentation-Plug-in
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    |----------------|
    |  INSTALLATION  |
    |----------------|
    
- In Blender go to Edit - Preferences - Add-ons - Install...
- Select the presentation_plugin.py file
- Check the box to enable the add-on
- Press N in the 3D Viewport for the plug-in UI 
    (Components, Presentation, Slideshow)   
    
    

WORKFLOW TIPS:
    - Create smaller presentations in one .blend file
    - Create separate .blend files ("Components") to form a bigger presentation
    - If you dowloaded the presentation_plugin.zip, look in the examples folder
        to get an idea, how a component could look
    - Switch to the created workspaces - Components, Presentation, Slideshow and Presenter,
        they offer prepared layouts 
    - Check the plug-in website for an instructional video

TLDR:
    - Use the provided workspaces (from the PRESENTATION_TEMPLATE.blend file)
    - Presentation can be divided into more "Components"
    - Components are separate .blend files, typically animated
    - One Component.blend file always has one camera object
    - Use timeline markers to define stop points or loops
    - Presentation is a separate .blend file
    - Use "Choose Components" in the Presentation UI Tab to import Components
    - Use "Override" to enable changes in the presentation
    - After any changes, use "Recalculate Cameras" 
    - Use F5 to start the presentation, F6 to end it
    - Use PageUp, PageDown for presenting (Next, Previous)



    |----------------|
    |   COMPONENTS   |
    |----------------|
    
- Components are parts of the presentation. 
- ONE COMPONENT = ONE COLLECTION IN .blend FILE
- !! EVERY COMPONENT NEEDS TO HAVE EXACTLY ONE CAMERA !!
- Make sure that all the component objects are in one Collection.
- It is advised that you use the Components Workspace while creating them.
        
- Use the Image Slides UI Tab to generate a component from images:
        - Choose how to arrange the images and set camera interpolation.
        - Select the images and the plug-in will do the rest...
- Use the Template Creation UI Tab to create a component template:
        - Assign types to placeholder objects in the scene.
        - You can filter out the unassigned objects (background).
        - Then generate a JSON file and fill it with actual data.
- Use the Component from Template UI Tab to generate components from the template:
        - With the template .blend file open, select the JSON file with data.
        - Plug-in will generate new .blend files filled with the JSON data.
- Or just make the components manually...

- You can create an animated scene and use MARKERS to define when will the
   animation stop, or loop:
        - Rename the markers to LOOP_START and LOOP_END to create a loop (animated slide).
        - Name it anything else to stop the animation (static slide).
   


    |----------------|
    |  PRESENTATION  |
    |----------------|
    
- Use the created components to form a presentation.
- ONE PRESENTATION = ONE SCENE IN .blend FILE
- It is advised that you use the Presentation Workspace for creating a presentation.
- The components that you use in each presentation are copied and altered in a folder 
    named after the presentation .blend file.

- First select in what shape you want to ARRANGE the components.
- Then customize the TRANSITION TIME.
- Finally choose the components you want to use in Component Import UI Tab, then Import them.
- You are free to move them around the scene afterwards.
- The components will appear in the order in which you have selected them.

- Use the Override button to enable changes:
        - !! RIGHT BEFORE USING THE OVERRIDE BUTTON, LEFT-CLICK INTO VIEWPORT 3D !!
                - Otherwise Blender will crash... It is an unsolved bpy.context problem
        - !! IF YOU DO ANY OF THESE CHANGES, YOU NEED TO RECALCULATE THE CAMERAS !!
                - Use the Recalculate Cameras button in Presentation Settings UI Tab
        - In the NLA Editor you can CHANGE the components ORDER, just filter by 'TIMERS'
                - Select the strip and move it to change th order
                - !! NO TWO TIMER STRIPS SHOULD OVERLAP !!
        - Choose more Components and import them to the presentation file
                - They will be added to the end of the presentation
        - Select a component a press the Delete Component button to remove it
                - !! DONT DELETE THE COMPONENTS BY PRESSING X OR DELETE !!
                - If you do, you can use the Reset Presentation to start over in the same file

- To change the content of the presentation components:
        - Change the altered copies of the component .blend files
            (they are stored in a folder named after the presentation .blend file)
        - Change the overriden component in the presentation
            (they are in the 'OVERRIDES' Collection after overriding)
                


    |----------------|
    |   SLIDESHOW    |
    |----------------|

- When your presentation is ready, its time to start presentig.
- If you are presenting on multiple screens, use Window -> New Main Window.
- That way you can use the Slideshow Workspace AND the Presenter Workspace.
- In the Slideshow Workspace you can press View -> Area -> Toggle Fullscreen Area
    to get rid of all Blender UI

- Use the buttons in the Navigation UI Tab, or your keyboard keys:
        - F5:        START THE PRESENTATION (switch to Slideshow)
        - F6:        STOP THE PRESENTATION (switch to Presentation)
        - PAGE_UP:   NEXT SLIDE (play animation forward)
        - PAGE_DOWN: PREVIOUS SLIDE (play animation backward)
        - HOME:      JUMP TO PRESENTATION START (frame 1)
        - END:       JUMP TO PRESENTATION END (last frame)
        
- !! YOU CAN CHANGE THE KEY BINDINGS BY RIGHT-CLICK + CHANGE SHORTCUT IN THE UI !!
